   <p>Slow Cooked Mac and Cheese. This has always been a comfort food for me. Its easy to make and wont cost you as much
      compared to other recipes. Slow cooker would be preferable but standard pot can work as well.</p>
      
      <p>This dish is great for big dinners or potlucks. Also can be used for sides for lunches and pre made dinners for the week</p>

        <li>In a large pot lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered,
             stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
        
             <li>Drain and transfer pasta to a slow cooker.
            Add milk and season with salt. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.</li>
